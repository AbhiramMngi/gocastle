I started the session by fixing 2 bugs I introduced with latests version of save/load.

First, I had removed the part that was creating Avatars from loadgame. I moved this bit around a few time, moved it around a few times between game.go and newgame.go while trying to factorize this. In the end, Avatars were only created in the new game, making the loadgame not loading images. I moved this bit in a new factorized function called initGame(window, start) in a screens/init.go file.

```go
// initGame will initialise all needed variables before start game (start=true) or load game (start=false)
func initGame(window fyne.Window, start bool) {
	var X, Y int
	player.RefreshStats(start)
	model.InitializeCategories()
	if start {
		player.AddObjectToInventory(model.BareHands)
		knife, err := model.CreateObject(model.HuntingKnife)
		if err != nil {
			err = fmt.Errorf("unable to add knife to inventory: %w", err)
			log.Fatalf("NewGame error: %s", err)
		}
		knifeIndex := player.AddObjectToInventory(knife)
		player.EquipItem(knifeIndex)
		player.ChangeGold(10)
		X, Y = currentMap.PlayerStart.X, currentMap.PlayerStart.Y
	} else {
		X, Y = player.Avatar.PosX, player.Avatar.PosY
	}
	player.Avatar = model.CreateAvatar(player.Avatar, X, Y)
	currentMap.AddNPCs()
	ShowGameScreen(window)
}
```

Second, all the images since the embed modification seemed to be saved in the JSON file. To remove them I had to make a copy of all objects containing avatars and nil-ing the CanvasImage.Image. 

This also made me realise that I had omitted (on purpose) the CanvasPath variable while doing the copy in CreateAvatar. This proved problematic once I wanted to recreate player and NPCs during load.

```go
    // Remove Image from character before saving
	playerSaveData := *player
	playerSaveData.Avatar.CanvasImage.Image = nil

	// Remove Images from NPCs before saving
	mapSaveData := currentMap
	for index := range mapSaveData.NPCList.List {
		mapSaveData.NPCList.List[index].Avatar.CanvasImage.Image = nil
	}
```

Third, I only had put a filter on load game extensions for file browsing (.sav files). I wanted to specify during the same game that I only want to save .sav files.

I tried to put a filter like for load but it didn't work while saving (though it effectively filtered files I could see during save game browsing). Though, by setting a placeholder "backup.sav", I hope people will understand.

```go
	// only allow .sav files
	fd.SetFilter(storage.NewExtensionFileFilter([]string{".sav"}))
	fd.SetFileName("backup.sav")
	fd.Show()
```

Forth, I wanted the load/save base directory to be the one the binary is launched from. To do this I created a function in the utils package to find this:

```go
package utils

import (
	"os"
	"path/filepath"

	"fyne.io/fyne/v2"
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/storage"
)

func GetBaseDirectory() (fyne.ListableURI, error) {
	executablePath, err := os.Executable()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	absoluteDirPath := filepath.Dir(executablePath)
	return storage.ListerForURI(storage.NewFileURI("file://" + absoluteDirPath))
}
```

And then used the SetLocation function from FineDialog for both load and save

```go
	location, err := utils.GetBaseDirectory()
	if err != nil {
		dialog.ShowError(err, window)
	}
	fd.SetLocation(location)
	fd.Show()
```

That should have been enough but for some reason URI is considered "not listable" whatever this means and I can't change it now with fd.SetLocation(location)...

Last but not least, I discovered [by reading this](https://fyne.io/blog/2021/01/25/introducing-fyne-v2.0.html) that Data Binding was more useful than as thought, as you can format string which I didn't think was possible

```go
data := binding.NewFloat()
slide := widget.NewSliderWithData(0, 10, data)
formatted := binding.FloatToStringWithFormat(data, "Float value: %0.2f")
label := widget.NewLabelWithData(formatted)
```

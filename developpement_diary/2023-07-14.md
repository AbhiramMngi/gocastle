Reworked the characterAspect NewRadioGroup in 3 columns and added logic to support this

```go
	characterAspect1 = widget.NewRadioGroup([]string{"👩‍🦰", "👨‍🦰", "🧑‍🦰", "👱‍♀️", "👱‍♂️", "👱"}, func(selected string) {
		resetRadioGroups(characterAspect2, characterAspect3)
		fmt.Println("Character Aspect 1:", selected)
	})
[...]
func resetRadioGroups(groups ...*widget.RadioGroup) {
	for _, group := range groups {
		group.SetSelected("")
	}
}
```

Added more conditions on "Validate" to make sure character creation is finished

Reworked layout to fit well in the window. 

I extracted all the variables for the character in a new model package (with a simple struct, for now):

```go
package model

type CharacterStats struct {
	PointsToSpend     float64
	StrengthValue     float64
	ConstitutionValue float64
	IntelligenceValue float64
	DexterityValue    float64
	GenderValue       string
	AspectValue       string
}

var Player CharacterStats
```

"New Game" menu is ready :\)

I then tried to create a simple map. First things I tried was to create a grid and put it in a scrollable container

```
func ShowMapScreen(window fyne.Window) {
	mapContainer := container.New(layout.NewGridLayout(50))

	for i := 0; i < 50; i++ {
		for j := 0; j < 50; j++ {
			image := canvas.NewImageFromFile("./static/grass.png")
			image.FillMode = canvas.ImageFillOriginal
			mapContainer.Add(image)
		}
	}

	content := container.NewMax(container.NewScroll(mapContainer))

	window.SetContent(content)
}
```

This doesn't work very well as elements (columns + rows) have spaces between them, leaving a blank grid.

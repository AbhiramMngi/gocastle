Added my first popup to tell player he/she forgot to allocate some point in character creation screen.

```go
		if PointsToSpend > 0 {
			content := widget.NewLabel("You still have available characteristics point to allocate!")
			dialog.ShowCustom("Points still available", "Close", content, window)
		}
```

```go
	characterGenderLabel := widget.NewLabel("Gender")
	genderRadioButton := widget.NewRadioGroup([]string{"Female", "Male", "Non-binary"}, func(selected string) {
	})

	characterAspect := widget.NewRadioGroup([]string{"👩‍🌾", "🧑‍🌾", "👨‍🌾", "🧙‍♀️", "🧙", "🧙‍♂️", "🦹‍♂️", "🥷", "🧝‍♀️", "🧝", "🧝‍♂️"}, func(selected string) {
	})
```

Added gender selection radio buttons + aspect selection button. Discovered that fyne 2.3 doesn't support emoji yet...

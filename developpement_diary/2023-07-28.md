Note: I split the whole DEV_LOG.md file in individual files under development_diary/ because file was getting too big. 

2 days ago, I discovered that you could bind data to Labels that would update automatically. At first I was excited and wanted to rework the whole statsbox but then I realized that the Labels I update in the screens/game.go updateStatsArea() function are complex strings made of multiple variables. Not that useful. 

I could bound the currentMap.Name to the label showing location in the statsBox in createStatsArea(), but issue is that it's a *canvas.Text, not a Label, because I wanted to change TextSize. Might be useful later though. See [developer.fyne.io/binding](https://developer.fyne.io/binding/)

I can now work again on the unfinished "inventory screen". I changed a bit the code which was obviously not working and now inventory is working in a basic way :\).

The design is pretty basic. For each category existing, create a dropdown menu, and the create a "Back" button that updates characteristics of the player and send us back to game screen:

```go
		// Create a dropdown list to display the items in the category
		itemDropdown := widget.NewSelect(itemsInCategory, func(selected string) {
			for i, item := range player.Inventory {
				if item.Name == selected {
					player.EquipItem(i)
				} else if player.Inventory[i].Equipped {
					// If another item was equipped, un-equip it
					err := player.UnequipItem(i)
					if err != nil {
						dialog.ShowError(err, window)
					}
				}
			}
		})
[...]
	// Create a "Back" button to return to the main menu
	backButton := widget.NewButton("Back", func() {
		// gear may have changed, reset all secondary stats
		player.RefreshStats(false)
		ShowGameScreen(window)
	})
```

I then created a lot more categories and tried to see if it fitted in our 800x600 screen. And it does (barely)

```go
// InitializeCategories initializes the categories with their names and descriptions.
func InitializeCategories() {
	GenerateCategories(
		[]string{
			"Weapon",
			"Body Armor",
			"Head Gear",
			"Belt Item",
			"Neckwear",
			"Overgarment",
			"Shield",
			"Gauntlets",
			"Boots",
			"Purse",
			"Belt",
			"Left Ring",
			"Right Ring",
			"Bracers",
		},
		[]string{
			"Weapons used for combat.",
			"Gear worn to the chest.",
			"Head gear (can be hats, helmets,...).",
			"Consumables that are easily accessible in combat.",
			"Items worn around the neck.",
			"Outer garments like cloaks or capes.",
			"Shields used for defense.",
			"Protective gloves for hands.",
			"Footwear.",
			"A container for money.",
			"A belt worn around the waist.",
			"A ring worn on the left hand.",
			"A ring worn on the right hand.",
			"Arm protectors.",
		},
	)
}
```

In order to reproduce the look and feel of Castle's inventory screen, I have to embed an image behind these dropdown lists. The layout was a bit tricky to get right but I managed to do something OK, for now.

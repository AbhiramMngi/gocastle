Note: I split the whole DEV_LOG.md file in individual files under development_diary/ because file was getting too big. 

2 days ago, I discovered that you could bind data to Labels that would update automatically. At first I was excited and wanted to rework the whole statsbox but then I realized that the Labels I update in the screens/game.go updateStatsArea() function are complex strings made of multiple variables. Not that useful. 

I could bound the currentMap.Name to the label showing location in the statsBox in createStatsArea(), but issue is that it's a *canvas.Text, not a Label, because I wanted to change TextSize. Might be useful later though. See [developer.fyne.io/binding](https://developer.fyne.io/binding/)

I can now work again on the unfinished "inventory screen". I changed a bit the code which was obviously not working and now inventory is working in a basic way :\).

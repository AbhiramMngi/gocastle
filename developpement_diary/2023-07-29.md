Just like I had created a stats box to display players important stats in the game screen, I added an inventory stats containing total weight, equipped items' weight and gold amount.

Sadly, the weight computation didn't seem to work at first.

That was due to a rounding error... I was dividing and int (200 grams) by 1000 to get kilograms. I have to cast it to a float32 before doing the division !!!

```diff
- totalWeightValueLabel.Text = fmt.Sprintf("%.3f kg", float32(player.InventoryWeight/1000))
+ totalWeightValueLabel.Text = fmt.Sprintf("%.3f kg", float32(player.InventoryWeight)/1000)
```

Once this was fixed, I added the amount of gold pieces to the inventory weight.

I also finally found why I got these error messages at startup

```go
2023/07/29 15:51:51 Fyne error:  Attempt to access current Fyne app when none is started
2023/07/29 15:51:51   At: /home/zwindler/go/pkg/mod/fyne.io/fyne/v2@v2.3.5/app.go:104
```

It's because I was creating the labels (canvas.Text in fact) objects in the global variables of screen package.

```diff
-	healthPointsValueLabel = canvas.NewText("10/10", model.TextColor)
+	healthPointsValueLabel *canvas.Text
-	manaPointsValueLabel   = canvas.NewText("10/10", model.TextColor)
+	manaPointsValueLabel   *canvas.Text
-	timeSpentValueLabel    = canvas.NewText("0d0:0:0", model.TextColor)
+	timeSpentValueLabel    *canvas.Text
```

Replacing them to this fixed 3 of the 4 errors. I still have to track the last one though...

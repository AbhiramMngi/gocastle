Inventory implementation is still really "early". Physical damage computation works but will take all items, including those un-equipped.

I've added values on items for "equipped" and "weight" :

```go
// Object represents an object with its properties.
type Object struct {
[...]
	Weight   int          // Object weight in grams
	Equipped bool         // Is object equipped
	Stats    []ObjectStat // Object stats (e.g., strength, health, etc.).
}
```

A few functions to equip/un-equip and modified DeterminePhysicalDamage() to only take into account equipped items.

Next logical step would be to create a new Inventory screen but There is something really painful I've not tackled yet : the map isn't centered on the player. You have to scroll manually and it's really not acceptable, especially if I start generating big maps.

It seems to be possible, [looking at this issue](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/894) using `.Offset`. After thinking a bit (determine that you don't want to move focus until you are over half of the screen), I had something working :\)

```go
// centerMapOnPlayer will center scrollable map focus on player as best it can
func centerMapOnPlayer() {
	x := float32(tileSize * player.Avatar.PosX)
	y := float32(tileSize * player.Avatar.PosY)
	if x < 400 {
		x = 400
	}
	if y < 300 {
		y = 300
	}
	scrollableMapContainer.Offset = fyne.NewPos(x-400, y-300)
	scrollableMapContainer.Refresh()
}
```

I used fixed values (400/300) at first, which is half of 800x600 and since it's the minimum size of the game screen it work great, even if you resize the screen. But I changed to use the real window value because it will look weird on big maps and bigger screen.

In the end it was a bit trickier than I thought because you can't get window size, you have to use container.Size(), but not scrollable ones because their size is off :-/

(See code comments for explanation)

```go
func centerMapOnPlayer() {
	x := float32(tileSize * player.Avatar.PosX)
	y := float32(tileSize * player.Avatar.PosY)
	containerX := mainContent.Size().Width
	containerY := mainContent.Size().Height - statsTextArea.MinSize().Height
	if x < containerX/2 {
		x = containerX / 2
	}
	if y < containerY/2 {
		y = containerY / 2
	}
	scrollableMapContainer.Offset = fyne.NewPos(x-containerX/2, y-containerY/2)
	scrollableMapContainer.Refresh()
}
```

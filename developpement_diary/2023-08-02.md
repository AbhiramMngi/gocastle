Since I was unable to understand why I couldn't change the location of the Fynedialog, I opened an [issue](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/4120). Turned out I was doing it wrong, even though I was sure I had tried it... Once I remove `"file://" + ` from NewFileURI it worked.

```go
	return storage.ListerForURI(storage.NewFileURI(absoluteDirPath))
```

I also tried to find a way to run `fyne-cross` instead of `go` to compile the binaries cross platform but still be able to take advantage of all the other goreleaer features and it took me a lot of time.

Now that we can kill NPCs, I see two logical next steps:
* give XP + random loot when they die
* make basic "AI" profiles rather than random movement

Giving XP is rather easy, but adding loot will need to create a whole need screen (inventory) so I'm going to limit myself to XP + (basic) leveling for now.

In NPCStat structure, I added the following stuff, and also added.

```go
	LootXP     int
	LootGold   float32
```

I also reworked some functions because I forgot you could add functions to structs, which is so much nicer than passing the reference as argument. I also added the XP counter and a Gold counter for the player (CurrentXP, CurrentGold) and functions

```go
func (npc *NPCStats) IsNPCDead() bool {
	return npc.CurrentHP <= 0
}
```

I rewrote / moved pretty much every function in game.go xD!

XP should always be gained in full, while there will be some random factor for gold, so I'll add to create those functions.

```go
// randomizeGoldLoot generates a random amount of gold within a specified range.
func randomizeGoldLoot(goldAmount int) int {
	if goldAmount <= 0 {
		return 0
	}

	// Seed the random number generator with the current time
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	// Generate a random multiplier between 0.5 and 1.5 (inclusive)
	multiplier := rand.Float64() + 0.5

	// Calculate the randomized gold amount
	randomizedGold := int(float64(goldAmount) * multiplier)

	return randomizedGold
}
```

Leveling up function looks like this

```go
func (player *CharacterStats) DetermineLevel() bool {
	for i, requiredXP := range xpTable {
		if player.CurrentXP >= requiredXP {
			// we are still above threshold, continue
			continue
		} else {
			// we are bellow next threshold, that's our level
			if i > player.Level {
				// only change level if it's greater than current
				// there could be effects removing XP but I don't want to affect level
				player.Level = i

				// Max HP changes during level up, also heal player
				player.GetMaxHP()
				player.CurrentHP = player.MaxHP

				// Max MP changes during level up, also reset MP player
				player.GetMaxMP()
				player.CurrentMP = player.MaxMP

				// base damage may evolve when you can add char points
				player.DetermineBaseDamage()
				return true
			}
			break
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

Now that we level up, let's write some basic "AI" for the monsters. What I have in mind is "if player is in close proximity", move toward him/her. To do this I need to compute the distance between the current NPC and the player. Since we have a grid, it's a simple Pythagora problem (le carré de l'hypothénuse).

```go
func (subject *Avatar) DistanceFromAvatar(subject2 *Avatar) float64 {
	dx := float64(subject.PosX - subject2.PosX)
	dy := float64(subject.PosY - subject2.PosY)
	return math.Sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
}
```

Then, if player is less than "10" in distance, go toward him

```go
func (subject *Avatar) MoveAvatarTowardsAvatar(subject2 *Avatar) (int, int) {
	// Calculate the distance between the Avatar and the other Avatar in the x and y directions
	deltaX := subject2.PosX - subject.PosX
	deltaY := subject2.PosY - subject.PosY

	moveX := 0
	moveY := 0

	if deltaX > 0 {
		moveX = 1
	} else if deltaX < 0 {
		moveX = -1
	}

	if deltaY > 0 {
		moveY = 1
	} else if deltaY < 0 {
		moveY = -1
	}

	// Update new Avatar's position to move one step closer to the other Avatar
	return subject.PosX + moveX, subject.PosY + moveY
}
```

Then, I can tweak the NPCs turn like this:

```go
		if npc.Hostile && npc.Avatar.DistanceFromAvatar(&player.Avatar) <= 10 {
			// player is near, move toward him/her
			newX, newY = npc.Avatar.MoveAvatarTowardsAvatar(&player.Avatar)
		} else {
			// move randomly
			newX = npc.Avatar.PosX + rand.Intn(3) - 1
			newY = npc.Avatar.PosY + rand.Intn(3) - 1

		}
```

Which works! 

NPCs are a bit dumb though and it's quite easy to trick them into going in line. They can't surround you.

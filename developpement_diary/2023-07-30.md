Today's task is to start implementing "Save game" and "Load game" screens.

Save game screen doesn't exist at all and Load game screen is empty. You can access the save game screen in-game so I have to bind a new key in the player's actions in the game screen to display it. Clicking back goes back to game screen.

Load game will be a bit trickier, since it could be called both from the main screen and the game screen. I'll have to find a way to pass from where we came to implement back button. But it's a problem for later, I'll just start by allowing load game only in the main screen for now.

The main save/load concept rely on the ability to get the current status of key elements in memory, create a coherent written form for this, store it on disk, and be able to re-read them afterward.

Fortunately is problem is pretty common and one super easy way to do this is to use JSON Marshalling/unmarshalling. I've read various articles about this in the past so I knew it would be feasible.

Now, I need to create the UIs for this. fyne has functions built-in to help with this:
* NewFileOpen
* NewFileSave

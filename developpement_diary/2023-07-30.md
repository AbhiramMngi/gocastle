Today's task is to start implementing "Save game" and "Load game" screens.

Save game screen doesn't exist at all and Load game screen is empty. You can access the save game screen in-game so I have to bind a new key in the player's actions in the game screen to display it. Clicking back goes back to game screen.

Load game will be a bit trickier, since it could be called both from the main screen and the game screen. I'll have to find a way to pass from where we came to implement back button. But it's a problem for later, I'll just start by allowing load game only in the main screen for now.

The main save/load concept rely on the ability to get the current status of key elements in memory, create a coherent written form for this, store it on disk, and be able to re-read them afterward.

Fortunately is problem is pretty common and one super easy way to do this is to use JSON Marshalling/unmarshalling. I've read various articles about this in the past so I knew it would be feasible.

* [https://www.golangprograms.com/golang-writing-struct-to-json-file.html](https://www.golangprograms.com/golang-writing-struct-to-json-file.html)

Now, I need to create the UIs for this. Fortunately fyne has functions built-in to help with this:
* NewFileOpen
* NewFileSave

Source: [https://pkg.go.dev/fyne.io/fyne/v2/dialog?utm_source=gopls#FileDialog](https://pkg.go.dev/fyne.io/fyne/v2/dialog?utm_source=gopls#FileDialog)

I've also found example on how to [use this in fyne (even though it's an issue)](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/3535)

the save game works like this:

```go
// ShowSaveGameScreen is the main function of the save game screen
func ShowSaveGameScreen(window fyne.Window) {
	// Get the data to save
	gameData := struct {
		Player     model.CharacterStats
		CurrentMap maps.Map
	}{
		Player:     *player,
		CurrentMap: currentMap,
	}

	// Show file save dialog
	dialog.ShowFileSave(func(writer fyne.URIWriteCloser, err error) {
		if err == nil && writer != nil {
			defer writer.Close()

			// Create JSON encoder
			encoder := json.NewEncoder(writer)

			// Write game data to JSON file
			if err := encoder.Encode(gameData); err != nil {
				dialog.ShowError(err, window)
			} else {
				dialog.ShowInformation("Game Saved", "Game data has been successfully saved.", window)
			}
		}
	}, window)
}
```

This function is super easy and it works, I'm amazed that this was so easy...

Instead of using json.Marshall, I used json.NewEncoder.Encode() because seemed prettier to write the "any" object directly to the io.writer stream, rather that json.Marshal() to a []byte and then write this to a file using ioutil.WriteFile()

> // Encode writes the JSON encoding of v to the stream, followed by a newline character.

The load game works like this:

```go
fd := dialog.NewFileOpen(func(reader fyne.URIReadCloser, err error) {
		if err != nil {
			dialog.ShowError(err, window)
			return
		}

		if reader == nil {
			return
		}

		defer reader.Close()

		data, err := loadGameFromFile(reader)
		if err != nil {
			dialog.ShowError(err, window)
			return
		}
		updateLoadedGameData(data)
		ShowGameScreen(window)
	}, window)

[...]

func loadGameFromFile(r io.Reader) (map[string]interface{}, error) {
	var data map[string]interface{}
	decoder := json.NewDecoder(r)
	err := decoder.Decode(&data)
    [...]
```

I create a fyne "file dialog", which create an io.reader. I can then use this io.reader in loadGameFromFile() to store JSON content "data" using json.NewDecoder.Decode().

> // Decode reads the next JSON-encoded value from its input and stores it in the value pointed to by v.

This is especially useful because it allows me to easily access data from map and data from player separately.

```go
// updateLoadedGameData updates the player and currentMap with the loaded data.
func updateLoadedGameData(data map[string]interface{}) error {
	// Update player
	playerData, ok := data["Player"].(map[string]interface{})
	if !ok {
		return fmt.Errorf("invalid player data")
	}
	if err := updatePlayerData(playerData); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to update player data: %w", err)
	}

	// Update currentMap
	mapData, ok := data["CurrentMap"].(map[string]interface{})
	if !ok {
		return fmt.Errorf("invalid map data")
	}
	if err := updateMapData(mapData); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to update map data: %w", err)
	}

	return nil
}
```

I can now update screens.player and screens.currentMap by unmarshalling JSON from playerData & mapData

```go
// updatePlayerData updates the player data with the loaded data.
func updatePlayerData(data map[string]interface{}) error {
	jsonData, err := json.Marshal(data)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if err := json.Unmarshal(jsonData, &player); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}
```

Once everything is loaded, we can now launch game at the state of the game when data was saved by calling ShowGameScreen(window)

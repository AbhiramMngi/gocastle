Today's task is to start implementing "Save game" and "Load game" screens.

Save game screen doesn't exist at all and Load game screen is empty. You can access the save game screen in-game so I have to bind a new key in the player's actions in the game screen to display it. Clicking back goes back to game screen.

Load game will be a bit trickier, since it could be called both from the main screen and the game screen. I'll have to find a way to pass from where we came to implement back button.

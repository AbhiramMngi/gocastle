Today, I just created a lot of new mobs (ants, kobold, goblins, orks, mimics, minotaurs) from the monsters I drawed during my holidays. Most drawings had too many details so I created a shorter version showing only the head on problematic monsters (like minotaur or goblin).

I increased the size of some images by removing the transparents borders on all images.

I also added little functions in CreateNPC() to set currentHP/MP to MaxHP/MP if it's not specifically set.

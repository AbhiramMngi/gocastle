The game is "playable" (but really limited) since a few days now and it's time to move on new *tough* topics. I see a few "next steps" that I'm going to throw there in no particular order:
* adding items on the floor and have the ability to pick them up / drop them down
* map transitions (being able to go from map to map)
* NPCs fighting back
* merchants / stores
* spells
* consumables
* infos on a given tile (name of the NPC if there is one, does he/it looks bad, ...)
* map generation (later on probably)
* "Fog of war" in dungeons

So I created the issues for all those features in [gocastle/issues](https://github.com/zwindler/gocastle/issues)
